(ns deflate.gzip
  "The gzip file format (RFC 1952): a variable-length header with optional
   filename/comment/extra fields, a raw DEFLATE stream, then a CRC-32 and the
   input size mod 2^32, both little-endian.

   Two details that are easy to get wrong and are handled here: a gzip *file*
   may be the concatenation of several members (`gzip -d` joins them, and
   `.tar.gz` produced by some tools relies on it), and the optional FHCRC field
   is the low 16 bits of the CRC-32 of the header — not of the payload.

   Written members are deterministic: MTIME is 0 and OS is 255 (unknown) unless
   given, so the same input compresses to the same bytes. Content-addressing a
   gzip member is otherwise not reproducible."
